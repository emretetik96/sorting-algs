This repository contains implementations of basic sorting algorithms.

First compile the files using

	javac *.java

Run the sort you want like so:
	
	java BubbleSort

and you will be prompted to enter the length of the list you would like to see sorted.

Perhaps Java is not the ideal implementation language for speed, but the reason I'm building this repository is to prepare for the final exam of my Data Structures in Java class.
